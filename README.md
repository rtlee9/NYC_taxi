# NYC_taxi

NYC taxi medallion analysis featured in my blog post _[NYC yellow cab trips: Neighborhood by neighborhood](http://eightportions.com/2016-07-14-NYC-yellow-cabs-neighborhoods/)_.

## Setup

1. Clone repo to local drive
1. Download [data](Resources.md#data) into the `./1.Data` path
1. Run scripts in the `2.Code/1.DataPrep` path sequentially
1. Run the `2.Code/2.AnalysisNeighborhoods/1.CreateViews.sql` script

## Analysis
All analysis beyond the setup described [above](#setup) can be found in the R Markdown source code for my post [here](4.Blog/2016-07-14-NYC-yellow-cabs-neighborhoods.Rmd). This code was knit into markdown for Jekyll with the [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package.

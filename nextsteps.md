# Next steps

* Heat map by key factors
* Map flows (Sankey, or other)
  * Use neighborhood centroids
  * All trips from one neighborhood
* Build volume predictive model
  * Subway closings
  * Number of subway entrances
* Clean SQL tables
  * Add 2015 taxi rides
  * Clean column [data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/datatype-numeric.html)
* User-input polygon - R Shiny
* Policy implications
* Net flows by nhood
  * Time lapse of net flow (rounded, location)
* Taxi volumes in subway deserts
* Vacation routes
* Same route, speeds and tips
* Taxi drivers - maximize dollars / min

## Documentation
Three-part series
1. Exploratory analysis
  * Heat maps
  * Tip by top model factors (best tippers)
1. Flow / network analysis
  * Where do people go, by neighborhood?
  * Where do people go after eating at 11 Madison
  * What are the most insular neighborhoods?
  * Where do Monday morning / Thursday evening LGA / JFK dropoffs come from? Pickups go to?
  * Biggest net inflow
1. Predictive model
  * What will the average tip be per day-hour / neighborhood / hour?
  * How much volume will come from each day-hour / neighborhood / hour?

# Next steps

* Full data run
  * Consider aggregation
  * Use sql for location mapping
* Heat map by key factors
* User-input polygon - R Shiny
* Map flows (Sankey, or other)
  * Use neighborhood centroids
  * All trips from one neighborhood
* Build predictive model
  * Volume model
    * Subway closings
    * number of subway entrances
  * Tip model
* Policy implications

## Documentation
Three-part series
1. Exploratory analysis
  * Heat maps
  * Best tippers
  * Tip by top model factors
1. Flow / network analysis
  * Where do people go, by neighborhood?
  * Where do people go after eating at 11 Madison
  * What are the most insular neighborhoods?
  * Where do Monday morning / Thursday evening LGA / JFK dropoffs come from? Pickups go to?
1. Predictive model
  * What will the average tip be per day-hour / neighborhood / hour?
  * How much volume will come from each day-hour / neighborhood / hour?

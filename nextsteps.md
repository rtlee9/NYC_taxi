# Next steps

## Long term
* Same route, speeds and tips
* Build volume predictive model
  * Subway closings
  * Number of subway entrances
* User-input polygon - R Shiny
* Taxi volumes in subway deserts
* Vacation routes
* Taxi drivers - maximize dollars / min

## Reasons for longer trips
* Avoid traffic / construction (use same time of day)
* Missed turn
* Bad data (use rounded 4 digit coordinates with many data points)

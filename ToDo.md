# To Do

## Near term - the long way home
* Random sample Google distance of all Manhattan trips
* Same routes - census blocks
* Random sample within top route

## Long term
* Same route, speeds and tips
* Build volume predictive model
  * Subway closings
  * Number of subway entrances
* User-input polygon - R Shiny?
* Taxi volumes in subway deserts
* Vacation routes
* Taxi drivers - maximize dollars / time

## Reasons for longer trips
* Avoid traffic / construction (use same time of day)
* Missed turn
* Bad data (use rounded 4 digit coordinates with many data points)

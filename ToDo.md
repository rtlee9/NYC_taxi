# To Do

## Near term - the long way home
* [ ] Reproducible code
  * [x] Set seed for random sample
  * [x] Shell scripts for taxi data upload
* [x] Random sample Google distance of all Manhattan trips
  * [x] Regression / machine learning model for long haul ratio
  * [ ] Add LGA pickup, dropoff as a factor

## Long term
* Collision [data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95/data)
* Same route, speeds and tips
* Build volume predictive model
  * Subway closings
  * Number of subway entrances
* User-input polygon - R Shiny?
* Taxi volumes in subway deserts
* Vacation routes
* Taxi drivers - maximize dollars / time

## Reasons for longer trips
* Avoid traffic / construction (use same time of day)
* Missed turn
* Bad data (use rounded 4 digit coordinates with many data points)
